# R Code for Mastering 'Metrics (Angrist and Pischke)

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

This repository R code and text for [R Code for Mastering 'Metrics](https://jrnold.github.io/masteringmetrics/), which contains the R code to reproduce the analyses in *Mastering 'Metrics* by Joshua D. Angrist and JÃ¶rn-Steffen Pischke.

The R packages needed to run the code in the examples and the datasets used in this book are installed by running
```r
devtools::install_github("jrnold/masteringmetrics", subdir = "masteringmetrics")
```

The site is built using the [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) package.
